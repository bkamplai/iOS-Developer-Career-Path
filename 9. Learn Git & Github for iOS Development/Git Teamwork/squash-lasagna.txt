Vegetarian Butternut Squash Lasagna

Ingredients:

3 3-pound squash, washed and cut into 1/2 inch cubes
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Large crystal sea salt and freshly ground pepper
1/2 cup butter
teaspoon of nutmeg
1/2 cup whole wheat or quinoa flour
2 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
4 cups goat milk
3/4 cup (lightly packed) fresh basil leaves
20 no-boil lasagna noodles
1 cup grated Parmesan

Instructions:
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a large pan, heat the extra virgin olive oil over low heat. Season the oil with a pinch of large crystal sea salt and freshly ground pepper.
3. Add the cubes of butternut squash to the pan. Splash a small amount of water into the pan to prevent sticking, then sauté the squash cubes until they become tender, which should take about 30 minutes.
4. Once the squash is tender, transfer it to a blender, food processor, or mash it with your hands to create a squash puree. Season the squash mush with additional salt and pepper to taste. Be careful not to oversalt or undersalt, finding the right balance is key.
5. In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the nutmeg and the whole wheat or quinoa flour to create a roux. Cook the roux for a couple of minutes until it becomes fragrant.
6. Gradually whisk in the goat milk, stirring constantly to avoid any lumps. Continue cooking the sauce until it thickens and reaches a creamy consistency. Stir in 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese until it melts and incorporates into the sauce. Reserve the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella for later.
7. Add the fresh basil leaves to the sauce and mix them in.
8. To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the cheese sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange a layer of no-boil lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.
9. Spread a layer of the butternut squash puree over the noodles, followed by another layer of the cheese sauce.
10. Repeat the layers, starting with noodles, then squash puree, and then cheese sauce. Continue layering until you run out of ingredients, ensuring that the top layer is the cheese sauce.
11. Sprinkle the reserved 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese on top, and then evenly distribute the grated Parmesan cheese over the dish.
12. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
13. After 30 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes or until the lasagna is bubbly, golden, and the noodles are tender.
14. Let the Vegetarian Butternut Squash Lasagna rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the layers to set.
